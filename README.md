# Family Tree Warehouse

<b>Marmara University / Computer Science & Engineering / CSE4060 - Principles of Programming Languages (2022)</b>

<b>Project</b>

<p>In this project, we made a family tree warehouse application. In this application, users can add new people to the tree. They can ask the level of relationship between two people in the tree. In the application, a warning is given for marriages under the age of 18. We provided controls such as the dead people cannot have children. Users can only add children or spouses to the first given tree. Gender, name, surname, date of birth, date of death, mother, father and children of a person in the tree can be accessed.</p>
